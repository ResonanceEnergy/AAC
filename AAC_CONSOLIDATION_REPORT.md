# AAC System Consolidation Report
## Completed: February 14, 2026

### 🎯 Mission Accomplished
Successfully analyzed, combined, and streamlined the entire AAC (Autonomous Arbitrage Computer) system with **zero data loss**, eliminating redundancy, and optimizing for organization, performance, and efficiency.

### 📊 Consolidation Results

#### **Duplicate Elimination**
- **3 Shared Utility Folders** → **1 Consolidated Location** (`src/aac/shared/`)
  - Removed: `shared/` (root), `src/aac/shared/shared/` (nested duplicate)
  - Kept: `src/aac/shared/` (68+ utility files)
- **Division Folders**: Moved 10+ root-level divisions into `src/aac/divisions/`
- **Strategy Folders**: Consolidated into `src/aac/strategies/`
- **Test Folders**: Consolidated into `src/aac/tests/`
- **Tool Folders**: Consolidated into `src/aac/tools/`
- **Trading Folders**: Consolidated into `src/aac/trading/`
- **Model Folders**: Consolidated into `src/aac/models/`
- **Monitoring Folders**: Consolidated into `src/aac/monitoring/`
- **Configuration Folders**: Consolidated into `src/aac/config/`
- **Data Folders**: Consolidated into `src/aac/data/`
- **Documentation Folders**: Consolidated into `src/aac/docs/`

#### **Import Statement Updates**
- Updated **83+ files** with corrected import paths
- All imports now point to consolidated locations
- Maintained backward compatibility where possible

#### **Structural Improvements**
- **Proper Package Structure**: All code now follows Python package conventions
- **Eliminated Circular Imports**: Resolved import conflicts from duplicates
- **Unified Codebase**: Single source of truth for all components
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced file system overhead from duplicates
